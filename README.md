# Caveclient
One of the first universal UI menu created for [Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/) dedicated to make your game experience easier & better.
## Installation
1. Download the .rar file.
2. Extract the files
3. Open caveclient-master
4. Here you will find a file called "tf"
5. Now find the "common" file on your computer. (Should look something like this: ...\Steam\steamapps\common)
6. Here you will also see a "Team Fortress 2" folder. Now simply take the "tf" folder from caveclient-master, drag & drop it over the "Team Fortress 2" folder.
7. And you're done. (If this doesn't do it, then join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/RfgA6wqzZP) for more support)

## How it works
The technique I used was to display the console output on to the game screen. This can be done via using the ```developer``` command. (0 = off | 1 = on) From here I use the ```echo``` command to display the text I want, then I use binds to redirect the menu to another echo menu. I use the command ```clear``` to clear the old menu.
