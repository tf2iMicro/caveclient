### Notes Regarding Caveclient Customization
- When adding custom commands, or changing features in the menu, you should have a clue of how it all works. Read more about that on the wiki.
- Due to my lack of experience, this menu isn't fully optimized. Something that can result in fps drop while using the menu. However, I'm still working on optimizing it to it's fullest extent!
